            Hi, I'm Gabriel Bryant, a passionate and driven computer engineering student. 
            Currently a sophomore in college, I graduated high school in 2023 and am on an exciting journey toward earning my master's degree. 
            I thrive on creativity, logic, and dedication, which fuel my love for solving complex problems and learning new technologies. 
            Right now, I'm working on projects that involve robotics and developing impactful software solutions. 
            I have a strong foundation in programming, with experience in Java, JavaScript, Python, C++, CSS, and HTML. 
            Alongside my software skills, I've honed my expertise in electronics, including soldering and working with components like Arduinos. 
            Designing is one of my passions—whether it's crafting a software application, building a hardware system, or creating something entirely new, 
            I love the challenge and creativity that design brings. 
            My determination and adaptability set me apart—there isn't anything I cannot learn, and I'm willing to travel anywhere and do whatever it takes to solve a challenge. 
            I see every problem as an opportunity to grow and innovate, embracing it with curiosity and enthusiasm. With a clear vision for the future and a commitment to excellence, 
            I'm excited to contribute to meaningful projects and make a lasting impact in the field of computer engineering. Let's create something remarkable together!
