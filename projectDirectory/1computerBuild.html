            <h2>    To be as efficient as possible I made all of my parts on PC Part picker which I will have linked below for my complete build. 
                This is my third PC I have made for myself with my first being in 2017 and my second being in 2019. 
                I built it in March after saving up money from my job and also some money I obtained from my Birthday. 
                The main thing I wanted to improve from my original computer was the speed because it was obviously getting old as it was 5 years old. 
                I started with an AMD Ryzen 7 7700X 4.5 GHz 8-Core because Intel is not aging well. As well as a 2 TB SSD along with a 128 M.2 SSD just to hold my system 32. 
                I also went with 32 GB of DDR5-6000 ram because I want this computer to be as fast as possible. 
                I kept a few parts such as my liquid CPU cooler and 850 W power supply from my old computer because those weren't things that needed to be upgraded. 
                The graphics card I went with was an ASUS 4070 because I like to play video games so a good GPU is essential for my hobby.
                I put Windows 10 on my computer because I am not a fan of Windows 11, this is likely just a bias as I have been using Windows 10 almost my whole life. 
                I bought just about everything from Micro Center with some exceptions because their deals are fantastic. Link for my build:
